# Project 9 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection

Description:

For this vulnerability I tried to inject couple simple commands such as such as ``admin` --`` , ``' or 1=1#``on the ``/blue/public/salesperson.php?id=`` directory. Overall, the ``sleep`` command seemed more vulnurble due to the page response time. ``' OR SLEEP(5)=0--'`` command increased the response time of the webpage by 5-10 second from regular request. Therefore it is vulnurble to SQL Injection and data exfiltration.

## Green

Vulnerability #1: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Description:

For this vulnerability, I took an advantage of the contact us section to try some malicious code. First I tried a very basic ``alert`` script in contact us section, and I went back to the admin section to view the script and found out that it is vulnrble to cross-site scripting.

## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

Description:
For this vulnerability I have discovered that there are no input check for userID in ``/red/public/salesperson.php?id=`` section. I tried user ``11`` and the site showed me the information that is visible in ``/red/public/territories.php`` directory.
